It's awful to log into a server, run `ls`, and get back dates out of order:

```
-rw-r--r--@   1 tomcat  staff   194230 Sep 27 15:06 localhost_access_log.09-27-2010.txt
-rw-r--r--@   1 tomcat  staff    79065 Sep 27 15:56 localhost_access_log.09-27-2011.txt
-rw-r--r--@   1 tomcat  staff    18234 Sep 29 12:37 localhost_access_log.09-29-2010.txt
-rw-r--r--@   1 tomcat  staff   293834 Sep 29 16:37 localhost_access_log.09-29-2011.txt
-rw-r--r--@   1 tomcat  staff    79360 Oct  3 15:00 localhost_access_log.10-03-2010.txt
-rw-r--r--@   1 tomcat  staff    19460 Oct  3 15:23 localhost_access_log.10-03-2011.txt
```

If you were going to organize these log files in folders, would your directory structure look like this?

```
Logs
|---09
    |---27
        |---localhost_access_log.09-27-2010.txt
        |---localhost_access_log.09-27-2011.txt
    |---29
        |---localhost_access_log.09-29-2010.txt
        |---localhost_access_log.09-29-2011.txt
```

Unlikely, so why do that with dates? Hierarchical information is best grouped starting with the broadest category and narrowing down. A better way to structure your dates would be:

> Year - Month - Day - Hour - Minute - Second

```sh
-rw-r--r--@   1 tomcat  staff    79065 Sep 27 15:56 localhost_access_log.2011-09-27.txt
-rw-r--r--@   1 tomcat  staff   293834 Sep 29 16:37 localhost_access_log.2011-09-29.txt
-rw-r--r--@   1 tomcat  staff    19460 Oct  3 15:23 localhost_access_log.2011-10-03.txt
```

Now that's much better!

PS: Hours should be in military style - it's the same idea!
