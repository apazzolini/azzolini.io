title: Deploying with SSH

I've deployed my personal applications in a lot of different ways over the years. This is my favorite. It's simple, reliable, and easy to automate.

### Triggering

I want to deploy with a simple `git push`. On pushes to the master branch, a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/apazzolini/azzolini.io/blob/master/.github/workflows/deploy.yml) SSHes
to my VPS with a restricted command key (sometimes called a single command or single purpose key) for the associated site.

```yaml
name: Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches: [master]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Deploy via SSH
        run: |
          eval `ssh-agent -s`
          ssh-add - <<< "$SSH_KEY"
          ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no $SSH_USER@$SSH_HOST
        env:
          SSH_USER: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_SSH_USER }}
          SSH_KEY: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_SSH_KEY }}
          SSH_HOST: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_SSH_HOST }}
```

On my VPS, `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` holds the following:

```
command="/apps/deploy/azzolini.io.sh",no-port-forwarding,no-x11-forwarding,no-agent-forwarding <the public key>
```

Whenever the deployment SSH key is used to connect to my VPS, it will automatically trigger the Bash script at `/apps/deploy/azzolini.io.sh`. This key
is unable to do anything else, so I'm comfortable giving it to GitHub.

### Building

This blog is a static site served by nginx. However, it is an Astro app, and as such needs to be generated. I do this with Docker
to avoid having to install Node on my VPS. You can see the Dockerfile [here](https://github.com/apazzolini/azzolini.io/blob/master/Dockerfile),
but the only interesting part is the very last line: `RUN tar -cf build.tar dist`. This creates a tarball containing the generated site, which we can
then easily copy to the VPS's filesystem.

The first half of the above mentioned Bash script does exactly that and is the following:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

set -e

cd /apps/repos/azzolini.io
git pull
docker build . -t azzolini.io:latest

docker run --rm azzolini.io:latest cat build.tar > build.tar
```

### Deploying

Lastly, we need to publish the new static site. All that's required is putting
the files in the right spot. The second half of the Bash script does this.

```bash
tar -xf build.tar
rm -f build.tar

rm -rf /apps/nginx-sites/azzolini.io
mv dist /apps/nginx-sites/azzolini.io
```

That's it!
