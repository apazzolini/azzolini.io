          <p>I'm a full-stack web developer currently living in Dallas, TX.</p>

          <p>I view programming as a craft to be appreciated not only for the end product, but for the code itself. There's a strong tie between the elegance and simplicity of a codebase and its correctness, performance, and ability to handle change.</p>

          <p>I love JavaScript and can't get enough of Node.JS and React.</p>

          <h6>Experience</h6>

          <p>My career started at a boutique consulting firm in Dallas, TX, Credera. I then joined a startup, Broadleaf Commerce as one of the core engineers. These two jobs gave me great insight not only into how to deliver robust and scalable applications, but also the actual process of solving business problems through technology.</p>

          <p>Iâ€™ve architected and built systems ranging from small, single-purpose Ruby apps to multi-server eCommerce websites for Fortune 500 companies. In addition to engineering, I've performed devops roles and led development teams.</p>

          <p>Most recently, I've been freelancing and love keeping up with bleeding-edge technologies.</p>

          <p>I graduated from the University of Texas at Austin in 2010 with degrees in both Computer Science and Management Information Systems.</p>
