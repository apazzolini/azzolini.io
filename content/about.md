title: Writing code is a craft

## Who is this guy?

I'm a full-stack engineer based in Dallas, TX that loves working with modern, functional JS.
We've seen significant advancements in JavaScript and web development over the last few years,
and I'm really excited for the future of the web.

Programming is a craft to be appreciated not only for the end product, but for the code itself.
There's a strong tie between the elegance, thoughtfulness, and simplicity of a codebase and its
correctness, performance, and ability to handle change.

## Experience

After graduating from the University of Texas at Austin with degrees in Computer Science
and Management Information Systems, my professional career started at a consulting firm in
Dallas, TX ([Credera](https://www.credera.com/)). From there, I joined a startup
([Broadleaf Commerce](http://www.broadleafcommerce.com/)) as a day-one engineer. These two jobs
gave me great insight into not only how to deliver robust and scalable applications, but also
the actual process of solving business problems through technology.

After that, I worked with Node, React, Kafka, Elasticsearch, and Aurora as the lead engineer at
a startup, [MVPindex](http://www.mvpindex.com). My time was split between architecting/developing
an asynchronous message processing and indexing system and API, managing the devops infrastructure
(AWS, Docker, GitLab), and supporting the rest of the team.

I'm currently working at [Float](https://www.float.com) as a Senior JavaScript engineer.

I've architected and built systems ranging from small, single-purpose Ruby apps to multi-server
eCommerce websites for Fortune 1000 companies. In addition to front-end and back-end engineering,
I'm very comfortable with devops, project management, and leading a development team.
