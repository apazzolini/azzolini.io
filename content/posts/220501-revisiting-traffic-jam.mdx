I wanted to try out Vite and a few related plugins for generating psuedo-static MDX sites, so I
rebuilt this blog that I never post on. I needed an example page, so I decided to re-implement
[Traffic Jam](/posts/traffic-jam) in React.

A quick recap of the rules: Players are allowed to move forward into an empty spot or jump over a person
directly in front of them, provided the two persons are facing each other and the spot behind the person
is empty. Players cannot move backwards. You win by moving all pieces to the opposite side.

import Game from './traffic-jam/Game.tsx';

<Game numPlayers={8} />

### So, how was it?

The setup was a little more annoying than expected. I think it's a little tough to statically render
MDX (since it can't fully flatten to just HTML), and the combination of vite-plugin-pages and the
Rollup plugin for MDX required some custom glue code.

For the most part, hot reloading works, but I did have to manually refresh the page sometimes, which is
always frustrating. Tailwind is a joy to use, and it's nice to author posts in Neovim (versus a previous
iteration of my blog that had an in-page editor). The autosolver in React required a bit of annoying
logic to manage state in a reducer, but was mostly straightfoward.
