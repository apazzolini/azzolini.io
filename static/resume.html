  <section>
    <p class="about">I'm a senior full-stack engineer in Dallas, TX that specializes in modern JavaScript development. I view programming as a craft to be appreciated not only for the end product, but for the code itself. I believe that there's a strong tie between the elegance and simplicity of a codebase and its correctness, performance, and ability to handle change.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>A Ruby / Sinatra based open source application that serves git-based documentation written in Markdown. It’s similar to Jekyll (which powers GitHub wikis), but supports versioning of the Markdown files with the normal git branching model. This powers the current Broadleaf Commerce documentation.</li>
