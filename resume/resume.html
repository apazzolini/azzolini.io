      <section>
        <p class="about">I'm a full-stack engineer in Dallas, TX that specializes in modern JS development. I view programming as a craft to be appreciated not only for the end product, but also for the code itself. There's a strong link between the elegance and simplicity of a codebase and its correctness, performance, and adaptability.</p>
